# pir-trigger
Camera trigger using PIR sensor

## Schematic TODO's
- [x] Run the PIR Conditioning circuit through Qucs/LTSpice
- [ ] Adjustable sensor sensitivity (needs digital pot, possibly over I2C)
- [x] Light sensor
- [ ] Cross-camera interface (Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Fuji - same interface, Sigma - inverted interface, Panasonic - needs special care)
- [ ] LED
- [ ] User button
- [ ] Jumper for total current measurement
- [ ] Test points, lots of them
